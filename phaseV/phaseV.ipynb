    "A short squeeze of the stock price of GameStop (GME), an American video game retailer, occurred during January 2021. Approximately 140 percent of GameStop's public float had been sold short, and the rush to buy shares to cover those positions as the price rose caused it to rise even farther. Major hedge funds and other large short sellers experienced large and swift financial losses as the price of GME spiraled out of control. The short squeeze was initially catalyzed by members of the the Reddit subreddit [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/). On January 28th, the short squeeze caused GameStop's stock price to reach a value of oven opening value of US \\\\$500 per share, nearly 30 times the \\\\$17.25 valuation at the beginning of the month. Many people have urged regulators to investigate r/wallstreetbets for stock manipulation while also suggesting that the subreddit be removed on reddit for promoting hate speech. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of our project is to assist regulators and moderators as they evaluate the overall post sentiment of r/wallstreetbets and determine if any action should be taken against the subreddit. To answer this question, we examined a subset of GameStop related reddit posts that were made on the r/wallstreetbets during the height of the subreddit's activity from late January to early April. We trained a multivariate linear model that predicted the sentiment polarity of a r/wallstreetbetsreddit post, either positive or negative, using the following features: the number of upvotes that the post received, the number of comments that the post received, the character count of the post's body text, the period during the day the post was authored - morning/afternoon/evening/night. Ultimately, we found our linear model to not be accurate in predicting r/wallstreetbets post title sentiment. We do not recommend our model to regulators or moderators looking to take sweeping action. "

    "**1. For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled?**\n",
    "   - Reddit data - was created to capture the sentiments of r/wallstreetbets in their posts during the meteoric rise of GME stock. WallStreetBets (r/wallstreetbets, also known as WSB), is a subreddit where participants discuss stock and option trading. It has become notorious for its profane nature and allegations of its users manipulating securities. Recently the community became mainstream again with its interest on GameStop shares.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**2. Who created the dataset and on behalf of which entity was it funded?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - Data Scientist and Kaggle contributor, [Gabriel Preda](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda), to satisfy his own personal research need.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - the data contains the 'title', 'score', 'url', 'number of comments', 'time of creation', 'post body', 'timestamp', and associated 'post id'. All of these instances serve to identify exactly 1 r/wallstreetbets post by a user at a particular time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. How many instances are there in total?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - There are 42552 total posts captured\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable, reported by subjects, or indirectly inferred/derived from other data? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - the data was downloaded from https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/ using `praw` (The Python Reddit API Wrapper) by the dataset's creator.\n",
    " \n",
    "**6. Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - the dataset is any actively growing sample of all r/wallstreetbets posts from Jan. 28, 2021 to present. Around Jan. 28, r/wallstreetbets was at its peak in media attention and coincided with the peak of GME stock. The sample may not be representative of the larger set since post topics on Reddit are not static (i.e. what users post today may not mirror the topics that they will post about tomorrow).\n",
    "    \n",
    "**7. Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - From January 28, 2021 to present (March 19, 2021)\n",
    "   \n",
    "**8. What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data or features? In either case, please provide a description?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - Raw user post data\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - some values in the 'body' column were NaN. This was done by the creator of the data set to indicate that the post had no post body.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - the data contains a copious amount of harsh language/emojis, which is used in a joking fashion, inside post titles and post bodies. The posts were not filtered in order to preserve the nature of r/wallstreetbets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**11. Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - the data captures direct postings by Reddit (a public social media platform) users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Is it possible to identify individuals, either directly or indirectly from the dataset?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - it is not possible to identify users by their posts unless they choose to identify themselves in their post (self-doxing). The usernames of each user are not provided in the dataset. However, the url of each post is identified and can be used to find the respective post on Reddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - No, the individuals were not notified about the data collection. However, Reddit is a public platform where all posts are publicly visible, so they did consent to the use of their data. As an interesting addendum, though, when r/wallstreetbets received increased media attention and its posts were documented by the media, users of the subreddit were either filled with pride/bravado or anger due to perceived misrepresentation of their posts. At points even CNBC (financial news) read r/wallstreetbets posts during TV broadcasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**15. Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - The 'created', 'url', and 'id' columns were useless to our planned analysis, so we removed them. Reddit gives users the option to provide a body to whatever topic that they post. The 'body' text was not much of particular interest to us. However, we felt that it was necessary to capture the length of each post body in case it was useful in analysis. We did this by deciding that a post that was 1000 characters long would have a 'body' value of 1000, while a post with no body (NaN) would have a 'body' value of 0. The timestamp column was converted into a datetime object from a string in order to enable easier comparisons. In order to ensure that the posts were relevant to GameStop. A simple Boolean search function was used to create the necessary subset. \n",
    "    \n",
    "**16. Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances available? If so, please provide a link or other access point?**\n",
    "   - Reddit - the dataset creator utilized [praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to scrape r/wallstreetbets post\n",
    "   \n",
    "**16. What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?**\n",
    "  - Reddit - [The subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) appears to have very strict moderation and this is reflected in the limited amount of posts in the 'new' section. Many posts appear to be deleted by moderator if they do not meet a certain standard of quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**17. Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data?**\n",
    "   - The dataset can be found here (Make sure to use a Cornell account to view) -> Cornell Box Link: https://cornell.box.com/s/hz8d86e2q8apoj28yz374zz9o8ukzvk6 (Refer to Uncleaned_Data Folder)\n"

    "During the time period of our analysis, there were some calls for law makers to examine the role of r/wallstreetbets in influencing to stock market. Some people called for the subreddit to be removed on the grounds of it being used for criminal market manipulation. Others called for the subreddit to be removed on the grounds that it was promoting hate speech. The data analysis in our project analyzes the latter concern. We trained a multivariate linear model that predicted the sentiment polarity of a r/wallstreetbets reddit post, either positive or negative, using the following features: the number of upvotes that the post received, the number of comments that the post received, the character count of the post's body text, the period during the day the post was authored - morning/afternoon/evening/night.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, our analysis showed that our model proved to failed in characterizing the sentiment polarity r/wallstreetbets posts based on title. There does not appear to be any relationship among the features that we selected for the model and post title sentiment score of GameStop related posts. This was our expectation before we conducted our analysis given the varied nature of the reddit dataset. Although not successful in a statistically significant way, our model surprisingly predicted all the reddit posts to be of positive sentiment. Broadly, there appears to be a large distribution of 'true' positive posts compared to 'true' negative posts in our dataset. Regulators and moderators perhaps should reconsider to negative characterization of r/wallstreetbets. Nevertheless, the choice of sentiment analyzer, sentifish, definitely impacted our findings. Employing a different sentiment methodology is bound to produce different results. It seems that r/wallstreetbets functioned more like a 'town square' where users shared their sentiment about stocks, which is no different than Twitter, Facebook, or simple word of mouth. We do not recommend our model to regulators or moderators looking to take sweeping action. "

   "source": [
    "**Reddit Dataset** - r/wallstreetbets post dataset is primarily limited by the time span in which the data was captured. The posts were recorded starting from Jan 28, 2021. This is one day after the peak stock price of GME on Jan. 27, 2021. It would have been nice to have data capturing posts before Jan 28, 2021 as we could better document user sentiment before GME's rise and its peak. The posts contain information not related to GameStop. This means we would have to find a way to filter relevant posts. We also converted the 'body' column to only record numerical character length instead of the actual body message. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentifish** - We opted to use an outside resource in order to conduct the the sentiment analysis for each reddit post. We also do not know how precisely the sentiment was calculated according to the library. The method of sentiment analysis chosen is bounded to produce different results in our project. In the future, we hope to learn to implement such analysis ourselves. Moreover, since not every post had body text, we instead opted to consider only the post's title. We sacrificed potentially more detail in exchange for uniformity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**r/wallstreetbets Moderation** - [The subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) appears to have very strict moderation and this is reflected in the limited amount of posts in the 'new' section. Many posts appear to be deleted by moderator if they do not meet a certain standard of quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GameStop/GME Reddit Post Search** - Our project only dealt with the subset of posts that mentioned GameStop or GME in their title. The boolean search method used to subset the reddit post data set (see Data Cleaning Appendix) could have been prone to filter posts out that were indeed relevant to GameStop. "
