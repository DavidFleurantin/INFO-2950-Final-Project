Likewise, the process to collect 1000s of posts would have resulted in too many api calls. The [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/reddit-wallstreetsbets-posts) dataset direct solves this issue and allowed to directly focus on the relevant time frame that we wanted that captured the phenomenon of GameStop's volatile and fluctuating stock price."
